          <strong>App inventor Project</strong>
          <h2>"Video Wall"</h2>
          <h5>This Project was made in CSP 1st Period</h5>

          <p>This is another project from my CSP class. For this project we were 
          supposed to make an app/program for the tablets from app inventor. We 
          were given with multiple app choices and we ened up with our 3rd pick:
          The Video Wall. We started working on it and we soon found out that the 
          App Inventor had multiple flaws. In the end we found out ways to solve 
          our issues. Two valuable skills I leared are problem solving skills and 
          improvising.
