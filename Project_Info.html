          <strong>Scratch Project</strong>

          <p>This was my first project in my CSP class. I made the game 
          using Scratch's Snap code. The goal for this project was to make a 
          game or story using Scratch. My partner and I decided that we 
          would make a game. The game required user interaction, multiple stages,
          and an objective. While making our game we thought we'd make a simple
          platformer game with multiple levels and a bonus stage. Our game was 
          sufficient and we were each given passing grades. Two skills I've learned
          from that project was Time Management skills and Patience
