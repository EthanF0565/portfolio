          <strong>Robotics & Engineering Project</strong>

          <p>This was a project that I worked on for my Robotics & Engineering 
          class when I was in Middle School. For this project, I was put in a team 
          and we were supposed to assemble a component for a factory. The factory 
          would consist of multiple components that the other teams around the 
          class would make. Right off the bat, my team and I made a plan. We 
          agreed that I would make the design and help with some of the building 
          while the rest of the team members would build and program. Two 
          skills I have learned in this project is Planning and Collaberation.
