                <p>Hello, my name is Ethan Fernando and im a Freshman in
                Dublin High School. I am really interested in the topic of 
                Computer Science and Biology. I plan to work as a programmer 
                though. I feel like I better understand computers more than
                biology To persue this goal I plan on taking programming classes
                all throughout highschool. I also want to go to a college that
                teaches Computer Science
                </p>
                  <p>I think that I have the abilities and skills that it takes 
                  for this goal. I am cautious and careful, and I try to make sure 
                  that I won't mess anything up. I'm also a team player. I really 
                  like working in teams, and I find working with other people to 
                  be a lot more engaging and comforting. I socialize well with 
                  others and I am open to share opinions with other people. I may 
                  have some trouble initially getting on task, but once im focused 
                  on something I can get a lot accomplished. I can prove to be 
                  helpful and my creativity can help my team a lot
                  </p>
                   <p>
                     From my work experiences, I have learned that I have a lot 
                     of difficulties focusing and staying on task, especially 
                     when im all by myself. I also noticed ways that could help 
                     me with those problems. When I listen to music sometimes I 
                     zone out and end up doing the task im given. Also, when im 
                     by myself in a quiet room everything is much more clear for 
                     me and im able to focus. When I am focused I can do many 
                     things. I can prove to be creative, helpful, and determined 
                     when I am focused
                   </p>
                    <p>
                     In the end, I see myself as a very social person who could 
                     contribute a lot to a team. I'm really good at socializing 
                     with other people and suggesting options that could help my 
                     team. I can use my creative abilities to help my team  
                     accomplish their goal. If you are reading this, thank you
