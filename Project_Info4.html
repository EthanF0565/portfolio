          <p>This a project that I worked on in a Robotics Club I used to go to.
          For this project, me and a partner were supposed to make a robot that 
          would play a game that was intended for vex robots. After the completion 
          of the robot, we would bring it to a competition and compete against 
          other people's robots to see which robot was superior. Two skills that 
          I learned from this project is Teamwork and Creativity.
